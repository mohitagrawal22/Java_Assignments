Q2.
1. What is the difference between a Unique Key and Primary Key?
we can have multiple colums as Unique key But primary key can be only one.
unique key prevents duplicate entries and can have Null value.
primary key is a combination of not null and unique. 
primary key is used to identify a particular row distinctly.
