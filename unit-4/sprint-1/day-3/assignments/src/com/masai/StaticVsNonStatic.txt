DIFFERENCE BETWEEN STATIC AND NOT-STATIC VARIABLE :

Static Members:
Belongs to class. 
Can be accessed using ClassName.memberName.
Static variable initializes with default values at the time of class loading.
All objects of a class share a single copy of static variables.

Non-Static Members:
Belong to Object.
Can be accessed using objectName.memberName.
Non-static variable initializes with default values at the time of object creation.
Each object has one local copy of the non-static variables.


Example :
For a Banking Application:
Static variables: bankName, branchName, ifscCode, phone, bankAddress
Non-static Variables: (each customer’s) accountNumber, name, phone, address
