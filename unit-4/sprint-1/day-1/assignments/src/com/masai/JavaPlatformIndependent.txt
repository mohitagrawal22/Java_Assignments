How java managed to be platform-independent:

In very basic term Java is platform independent because of its byte-code.
A .Java file known as the source code, is compiled and converted into .class file known as 
the byte-code. 
This java byte-code is platform-independent, which means it can run on multiple platforms
i.e. Write Once and Run Anywhere(WORA).
These multiple platforms or Operating-system has JRE (Java Runtime Environment).
We can also download this JRE, for various Operating-system separately.
This JRE has a software component called JVM (Java Virtual Machine), this JVM
takes our java byte-code and translates it to the native code for the underlying OS.
we can compile the java code in one Operating System and execute it on another Operating System.
